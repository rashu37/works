1 Difference between the Checked and Unchecked Exception

Checked Exception= These Exception are checked at compile time.
Example= ClassNotFoundException,IOException

Unchecked Exception=These Exception are checked at Run time.
Example=Arthematic Exception, NullPointerException

2 Polymorphism= Polymorphism is concept of object-oriented programming language. where having same method signature but implementation is different. there are two types of polymorphism 1) Compile-time polymorphism(method Overloading) 2) Run time polymorphism(method overriding).
  1 method Overloading =Having same method Name but Different Parameters is called overloading.
  2 method Overridding= Having Same method Signature but difference in implementation is called methodOverriding

3 Abstraction= Abstraction is concept of Object-Oriented programming language. Hiding the implementation part and displaying only necessary part in the program. 
To achieve the abstract class, we need to write a class using abstract keyword and then should implements in parent class. In this way what we write a methods in the abstract class, that will implemented in Parent class. so, here we can acheive the Abstraction.
As same way to interfaces classes but only thing is interface keyword is changed.

4 ArrayList= * ArrayList internally uses a dynamic array to store the elements. 
             * There is shift in Array if any one deleted the index.

  LinkedList=* LinkedList internally uses a doubly linked list to store the elements.
             * There is no bit shifting in the LinkedList.
